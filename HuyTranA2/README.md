## 4. What worked well in your development process?
...  All the things other than the kivy work well afterall.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
...  I would start much sooner in order to have more time to fix errors like can not recognize kivy module.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
...  I felt that installing an new app to the code and run it clearly by coding it all by myself is very difficult. I tried to work it out with my friends that have experience about this area.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
...  Yes, the classes help my code to be clearly to classify.
